In order to launch the genetic algorithm :

- from the Excel file, first make sure that the 
  right path to "Anaconda3\python.exe" is written 
  into the "main.bat" and the "main_gen.bat" files.
  Then the Excel file works as it was before, except
  for the genetic algorihm function which could be
  launched thanks to the new "genetic" button.


- from any terminal, you just have to run the 
  "main_gen.py" directly.
